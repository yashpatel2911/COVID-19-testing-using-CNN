# COVID-19-testing-using-CNN-Chest-X-Ray
During this COVID-19 pandemic, the testing of COVID patient requires a COVID testing kit which sometimes become shortage due to high rate of expansion of COVID. To tackle that problem, I tried to make a deep learning model that identifies that the person has COVID or not by his/her X-Ray of chest. I have collected the dataset of X-Ray of chest from Kaggle.
